      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I am a mechanical engineer and Engineering MBA candidate with experience spanning
        construction, upstream energy, and operational analytics. My background has been
        shaped by environments where engineering decisions directly impact safety, cost,
        and long-term asset performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&amp;M University
        and passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, building a strong foundation
        in technical analysis, systems thinking, and problem solving. During my undergraduate
        education and early professional experiences, I became increasingly interested in
        roles that bridge engineering execution with business and operational decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professionally, I have worked in both heavy civil construction and upstream oil and gas.
        At Kiewit, I served as a Pipe Field/Office Engineer Intern on a large municipal water
        infrastructure project. My responsibilities included pipe procurement forecasting,
        surveying for installations, pretest walkdowns, and coordination of daily activities
        for a large craft workforce.
      </p>

      <p>
        More recently, I completed an internship with Formentera Operations in the upstream
        energy sector. There, I focused on operational analytics by designing a well failure
        tracking system and developing a live critical gas rate calculator to support gas lift
        optimization. This experience reinforced my interest in using data and engineering
        principles to improve reliability and decision quality at scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently pursuing the Anthony Bahr ’91 Engineering MBA at Mays Business School
        to further develop my skills in finance, operations, and organizational leadership.
        My goal is to build a career at the intersection of engineering, analytics, and business,
        contributing to operational excellence and long-term value creation.
